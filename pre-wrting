Rough Draft

Computer Vision, often introduced along with the term “image understanding”, is a technology that collects and learns information from the real world by analyzing images and videos taken by cameras. Once the image is understood by a computer, the digital device can then achieve specific goals using algorithms that have been programmed into it. As a commonly used technology, facial recognition is also an application of Computer Vision.
  
Computer Vision development can be divided into three levels: low level, middle level and high level. The low level development focus on the mathematics applied in the Computer Vision algorithms. The middle level is about using existing computer vision modules. The high level interprets the information provided by low level and middle level, and utilizes that data to achieve specific tasks. 

Although computer vision and image processing have many properties in common, these two technologies differ from each other in their fundamentals. Computer Vision serves computers as the part of human brain that understands a image, and reacts according to the visual information. Computer Vision tries to understand and analyze images using the data collected from the camera. Once the data is processed with certain algorithms, computer vision allows digital systems to perform promised functions. However, a raw picture often contains too much information and noise, Computer Vision utilizes image processing tool to perform such as, contour tracing, grayscale, color filter to make analysis possible. An real-life example will be that it’s hard for human brain to understand the environment when it’s too bright, wearing sunglasses reduces the brightness, so a image can be accepted by a human brain. Image processing serves a tool to manipulate the raw image so that Computer Vision functions can be achieved  with less processing power of the computer. 

Human eyes are limited by biological structures that human eyes can’t achieve certain tasks without other tools. For example, human eyes can only recognize visible light within a specific spectrum, anything outside this range is considered invisible to human eyes.  Also human eyes cannot tell the difference when objects are moving at a high speed. For example, the VGA display is designed to show pixels in an one-by-one order. Since the pixels update at a high frequency human beings see these points as they are shown simultaneously. 

Computer Vision is broadly used in life, traffic sign detector is one of the applications. For example, by running a color-recognition algorithm, the implemented computer is able to tell the color of the traffic lights, so to decide whether to proceed or to stop. Another application of Computer Vision on self-driving vehicles is speed-limit recognition. When autonomous vehicles are operating under safe speed, it allows the car to have more time and space to avoid a hazardous situation.    

Computer Vision has a promising future as the requirements of automation increases in the industry. With high-resolution cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms, digital systems are able to replace human beings in many areas as machines now collect more information about the outside environment and react at a fast speed.
